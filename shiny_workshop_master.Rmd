```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

require(shiny)
require(shinythemes)

```

Ideas:
- have students google a picture of a penguin and add it to their app
- radio buttons to display something by species
- work through alison's first example
- each group will do a different tab
- navigate shiny gallery - if they ever want to develop their own shiny app we can show them different tools
- adding another line
