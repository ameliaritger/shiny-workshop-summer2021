```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

require(shiny)
require(shinythemes)

```

Ideas:
- have students google a picture of a penguin and add it to their app
- radio buttons to display something by species
- work through alison's first example
- each group will do a different tab
- navigate shiny gallery - if they ever want to develop their own shiny app we can show them different tools
- adding another line

Amelia's notes:
Hands on work through Alison's https://vimeo.com/356696243
Have students google photo of penguin and embed
1. use Alison's first template (look up the rmarkdown from her) 
2. create key .rmd and blank .rmd, upload penguin data too
Show students how to search for things on the shiny gallery (Shiny Demo)
Each group will make a different tab of Alison's shiny app
